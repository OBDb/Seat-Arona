    description: "The SEAT Arona is the Spanish brand's first subcompact crossover SUV, introduced to capitalize on the rapidly growing small SUV segment in Europe. Built on the Volkswagen Group's MQB A0 platform shared with the SEAT Ibiza, Volkswagen Polo, and Volkswagen T-Cross, the Arona features a raised ride height and SUV-inspired styling while maintaining compact dimensions suitable for urban driving. Named after a municipality in Tenerife, Spain, the Arona measures approximately 4.14 meters in length, positioning it as one of the more compact offerings in its class. Engine options at launch included 1.0 TSI three-cylinder turbo gasoline engines in 95 or 115 horsepower variants, a 1.5 TSI four-cylinder with 150 horsepower, and 1.6 TDI diesel options producing between 95 and 115 horsepower. Transmission choices include five or six-speed manuals and seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatics depending on engine selection. The interior features SEAT's driver-focused design with a central touchscreen (initially 8 inches, later up to 9.2 inches with the facelift) for infotainment functions, available digital instrument cluster, and practical storage solutions. A significant facelift in 2021 brought updated exterior styling with new LED headlights, a revised grille, and modified bumpers, while the interior received upgraded technology including improved connectivity and voice control. The updated model also introduced the rugged-looking Xperience trim with additional body cladding and styling elements suggesting enhanced off-road capability. Despite its crossover positioning, the Arona is exclusively front-wheel drive across all variants, focusing on city-friendly maneuverability and efficiency rather than genuine off-road capability. The Arona has become one of SEAT's most successful models, appealing to buyers seeking the elevated driving position and style of an SUV with the manageable dimensions and running costs of a supermini."
