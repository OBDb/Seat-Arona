    description: "The SEAT Arona is the Spanish brand's first subcompact crossover SUV, introduced to capitalize on the rapidly growing small SUV segment in Europe. Built on the Volkswagen Group's MQB A0 platform shared with the SEAT Ibiza, Volkswagen Polo, and Volkswagen T-Cross, the Arona features a raised ride height and SUV-inspired styling while maintaining compact dimensions suitable for urban driving. Named after a municipality in Tenerife, Spain, the Arona measures approximately 4.14 meters in length, positioning it as one of the more compact offerings in its class. Engine options at launch included 1.0 TSI three-cylinder turbo gasoline engines in 95 or 115 horsepower variants, a 1.5 TSI four-cylinder with 150 horsepower, and 1.6 TDI diesel options producing between 95 and 115 horsepower. Transmission choices include five or six-speed manuals and seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatics depending on engine selection. The interior features SEAT's driver-focused design with a central 8-inch touchscreen for infotainment functions, and practical storage solutions. Despite its crossover positioning, the Arona is exclusively front-wheel drive across all variants, focusing on city-friendly maneuverability and efficiency rather than genuine off-road capability."
